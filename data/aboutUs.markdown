# About Us

## India’s Trusted Export House for Ayurvedic Herbs, Botanical Ingredients & Natural Raw Materials

Unity Commerce is an Indian export house focused on supplying Ayurvedic herbs, botanical ingredients, and natural raw materials to international buyers who require consistency, clarity, and compliance. The company works with verified producers and processing units across India, ensuring that each batch of material is sourced responsibly, cleaned, graded, and packed in alignment with international quality expectations.

Our operations are built on one principle — **Trade Meets Trust**.

We focus on supplying the exact raw materials that buyers request, without altering, modifying, or overstating their properties. Every product is supplied in the form used by the industry—whether whole roots, powders, dried leaves, extracts, or cut pieces—based strictly on the buyer’s specifications and intended application.

Unity Commerce does **not** deal in finished medicines or therapeutic products. We specialize exclusively in raw herbs and natural ingredients, prepared in forms suitable for further processing, formulation, and packaging by the buyer. By maintaining clear standards for drying, grading, and packing, we ensure materials are suitable for powders, capsules, tablets, decoctions, extracts, cosmetics, and functional blends, depending on manufacturing requirements.

## Introducing Ashwayu  
### The Consumer Brand of Unity Commerce

### Premium Ayurvedic Wellness, Backed by Export-Grade Quality

Ashwayu is the consumer-facing Ayurvedic brand launched under Unity Commerce. While Unity Commerce focuses on supplying raw herbs and bulk botanical ingredients to international buyers, Ashwayu brings the same export-grade quality directly to consumers through packaged powders, herbal blends, and natural wellness products.

Ashwayu products include single-herb powders, plant-based ingredients, and natural raw materials intended for home consumption, personal use, and general-purpose applications such as herbal drinks, paste preparations, cosmetic mixtures, and dietary blends. Each product is sourced through the same network used for exports, ensuring consistency in raw material quality.

To maintain clarity of identity, Ashwayu operates through two structured product lines:

---

## Ashwayu Herbal

This category includes traditional Ayurvedic single-herb powders such as Ashwagandha, Neem, Moringa, Giloy, Shatavari, Triphala ingredients, and similar raw herbal materials. These products are intended for mixing, decoction preparation, blending, and other household or formulation-related uses.

---

## Ashwayu Naturals

This line includes natural, plant-based ingredients commonly used for cosmetic, personal-care, and functional household purposes, such as aloe-based powders, herbal flakes, and other plant-derived materials. These products are positioned for general natural-use applications without making medicinal claims.
