For quotation requests and detailed product requirements, buyers can use the enquiry form. Responses are provided within 24 hours with relevant specifications, pricing, and shipping options.

All communication is handled by the export coordination team, which records each enquiry and links it to the requested product type, destination country, and required specifications. This ensures that follow-up responses include accurate information regarding available grades, packing formats, dispatch timelines, and documentation needs.

Buyers who require country-specific paperwork—such as phytosanitary certificates, fumigation reports, or commercial documentation formats—can request them during the initial enquiry. These requirements are reviewed before quotation to avoid discrepancies during shipment.

For ongoing supply arrangements, Unity Commerce maintains an internal reference for past consignments, allowing the team to provide consistent batch characteristics, preferred packaging weights, and shipping modes used previously by the same buyer. This helps maintain continuity in multi-order relationships and reduces clarification cycles.

All queries related to logistics, compliance formats, and product suitability are addressed through direct communication so that buyers receive clear, structured responses without unnecessary steps.
