# Unity Commerce

**India’s Trusted Export House for Ayurvedic Herbs, Botanical Ingredients & Natural Raw Materials**

Unity Commerce is an Indian export house focused on supplying Ayurvedic herbs, botanical ingredients, and natural raw materials to international buyers who require consistency, clarity, and compliance.

The company works with verified producers and processing units across India, ensuring that each batch is responsibly sourced, cleaned, graded, and packed to meet international quality expectations.

**Our guiding principle:**
**Trade Meets Trust**

We supply raw materials exactly as requested—without altering, modifying, or overstating properties. Products are delivered in industry-standard forms such as whole roots, powders, dried leaves, extracts, or cut pieces, strictly based on buyer specifications.

Unity Commerce **does not** deal in finished medicines or therapeutic products. We specialise exclusively in raw herbs and natural ingredients suitable for further processing, formulation, and packaging.
