## 2. FSSAI Compliance  
**Food Safety and Standards Authority of India**

- Materials supplied for ingestion-based manufacturing meet basic Indian food safety parameters  
- Products are sourced, handled, and packed according to recognised safety standards

## 3. IEC License (Import Export Code)  
**Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT)**

Unity Commerce holds a valid IEC (Import Export Code), which is mandatory for conducting export and import activities in India.

**The IEC ensures that:**
- All export transactions are legally recorded with Indian customs  
- Shipments can be processed through ports, airports, and ICD facilities  
- Buyers receive consignments supported by proper statutory documentation  

Without an IEC, international trade is not legally permitted. Our IEC registration confirms that every transaction complies with India’s foreign trade regulations.

## 4. ISO Quality Standards (Where Applicable)  
**Process Structure for Consistency**

Unity Commerce works with processing facilities that follow ISO-aligned quality management practices, particularly for cleaning, drying, grading, and packing operations.

While ISO certification is held by partner facilities (where applicable), Unity Commerce ensures that:
- Each batch is handled according to defined procedures  
- Hygienic processing conditions are consistently maintained  
- Clear specifications are followed for moisture control, grading, and packaging  

This structured approach supports supply consistency for global buyers who rely on repeatable quality standards.
