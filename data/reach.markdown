# Reach

Unity Commerce supplies Ayurvedic herbs, botanical ingredients, and natural raw materials to buyers across multiple international markets. Our export routes are structured to meet region-specific import standards, packaging norms, and documentation requirements.

## Global Export Destinations

We currently ship to global buyers across regions such as:

- Canada  
- France  
- Germany  
- Italy  
- UAE  
- Russia  
- The Netherlands  
- Several other countries where import regulations support plant-based raw materials  

## Compliance & Logistics

Every shipment follows country-specific compliance formats, including:

- Packaging specifications  
- Moisture-control requirements  
- Legally accepted documentation for customs clearance  

Our logistics network is coordinated through air and sea freight partners to ensure stable transit timelines for bulk orders.

## Operational Standards

Unity Commerce continues to expand its reach based on:

- Market demand  
- Regulatory feasibility  
- Long-term buyer relationships  

All export destinations are supported with consistent quality standards and verified sourcing.

Each destination operates under a documented workflow that defines:

- Product suitability  
- Buyer preferences  
- Expected transit duration  
- Required certifications  

This ensures materials are prepared according to regional commercial and regulatory standards. Factors such as moisture thresholds for powders, labelling requirements, palletisation practices, and accepted microbial limits vary by region and are assessed prior to dispatch.

## Repeat Orders & Consistency

Repeat orders are supported by internal references to previously shipped batches, ensuring consistency across consignments.

Buyers with long-term procurement schedules are assigned:

- Predefined packing formats  
- Fixed dispatch timelines  

These are aligned with their internal processing or manufacturing cycles.

## Market Expansion Approach

As new markets are added:

1. Pilot shipments are aligned with destination-specific documentation and customs expectations  
2. Import pathways are validated for stability  
3. Approved routes are integrated into Unity Commerce’s regular export map  

This incremental approach enables expansion while maintaining compliance, quality, and reliability.
